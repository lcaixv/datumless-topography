# Datumless Topography: A Universally Consistent Way to Quantify Relief
Kai Xu, Yale University

Google Earth Engine script (JavaScript) for computing four datumless measures: dominance, jut, submission, and rut.

The first step is to create a Google Earth Engine account [here](https://earthengine.google.com/new_signup/). You need to be approved for a valid purpose. If they ask you for your purpose for creating an account, tell them that you are interested in computing the datumless topographic measures and send this link [https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01600] to them to increase your chances of being approved.

Next, use this link to access the code for the datumless measures.
