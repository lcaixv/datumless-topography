# Code for Datumless Measures of Topographic Relief: Dominance, Jut, Submission, and Rut
***Kai Xu, Yale University***

This repo provides the Google Earth Engine scripts (in JavaScript) for computing four datumless measures of topographic relief: **_dominance_**, **_jut_**, **_submission_**, and **_rut_**. These concepts are explained in my research paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01600). For much friendlier explanations, check out these five-minute reads about [dominance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mountaineering/comments/wfmrxw/a_new_way_to_measure_the_height_of_a_mountain/), [jut](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mountaineering/comments/wup76h/a_new_way_to_quantify_the_impressiveness_of_a/), and [dominant points](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mountaineering/comments/ww1wtw/on_top_of_the_world_a_new_mountain_metric/) (related to submission and rut).

To compute the datumless measures, the first step is creating a Google Earth Engine account [here](https://earthengine.google.com/new_signup/). For the question "What would you like to accomplish with Earth Engine?", say that you are interested in computing the datumless measures of topographic relief, and also include the link of the research paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01600). Your account should be approved within a few hours to a few days.

Desciption

It was known to me after writing the paper that dominance was first invented by Andy Martin and Jerry Brekhus in 2006.
