# Datumless Topography: A Universally Consistent Way to Quantify Relief
## Kai Xu, Yale University

Google Earth Engine script (JavaScript) for computing four datumless measures: dominance, jut, submission, and rut.

The first step is to create a Google Earth Engine account [here](https://earthengine.google.com/new_signup/). Google will ask for your reason for creating an account. To increase your chances of approval, tell them that you are interested in computing the datumless topographic measures and include the link of the research paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01600). The approval process should take a few hours to a few days.
