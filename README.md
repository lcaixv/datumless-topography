# Code for Datumless Measures of Topographic Relief: Dominance, Jut, Submission, and Rut
***Kai Xu, Yale University***

This GitHub repo provides the scripts for Google Earth Engine script (JavaScript) for computing four datumless measures: dominance, jut, submission, and rut. These measures are described in my research paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01600).

The first step is to create a Google Earth Engine account [here](https://earthengine.google.com/new_signup/). For the question "What would you like to accomplish with Earth Engine?" say that you are interested in computing the datumless measures of topographic relief, and include the link of the research paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01600). The approval process should take a few hours to a few days.

Description

It was known to me after writing the paper that dominance was first invented by Andy Martin and Jerry Brekhus in 2006.
