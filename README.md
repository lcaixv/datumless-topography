# Datumless Topography: A Universally Consistent Way to Quantify Relief
## Kai Xu, Yale University

Google Earth Engine script (JavaScript) for computing four datumless measures: dominance, jut, submission, and rut. Link to my research paper: 

The first step is to create a Google Earth Engine account [here](https://earthengine.google.com/new_signup/). For the question "What would you like to accomplish with Earth Engine?" tell them that you are interested in computing the datumless measures of topographic relief, and include the link of the research paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01600). The approval process should take a few hours to a few days.
