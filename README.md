# Code for Datumless Measures of Topographic Relief: Dominance, Jut, Submission, and Rut
***Kai Xu, Yale University***

This repo provides the Google Earth Engine scripts (JavaScript) for computing four datumless measures: dominance, jut, submission, and rut. These concepts are explained in my research paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01600). For friendlier explanations of these concepts, check out these articles about [dominance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mountaineering/comments/wfmrxw/a_new_way_to_measure_the_height_of_a_mountain/), [jut](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mountaineering/comments/wup76h/a_new_way_to_quantify_the_impressiveness_of_a/), and [dominant points](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mountaineering/comments/ww1wtw/on_top_of_the_world_a_new_mountain_metric/) (related to submission and rut).

The first step is to create a Google Earth Engine account [here](https://earthengine.google.com/new_signup/). For the question "What would you like to accomplish with Earth Engine?" say that you are interested in computing the datumless measures of topographic relief, and include the link of the research paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01600). The approval process should take a few hours to a few days.

Description

It was known to me after writing the paper that dominance was first invented by Andy Martin and Jerry Brekhus in 2006.
